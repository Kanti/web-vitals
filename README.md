# Web Vitals Tracker 🔺🟨🟢

Real Measurement Web Vitals Statistic for your TYPO3  
_[More information about Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/)_

## install 🎁

```composer req kanti/web-vitals-tracker```

Or via [the Extension Reposiotry](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/web_vitals_tracker)

## How dose it work 🦾

We inject a small javascript file _(2.6kb gziped)_ into the frontend,  
that uses the [web-vitals package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-vitals) to collect the timings of every page request.  
The data is sent to the TYPO3 and saved in the database.

## how dose it look like 👀

## Get support 🆘

currently, the only support you can ask for is a  [github Issue](https://github.com/Kanti/web-vitals/issues?q=)

## Open Questions ❓

- what about Sites with a lot of Traffic?  
after 1_000_000 requests MySQL gets pretty slow (1,2s on my Laptop)
- What about nice 404 Sites, will it still measure the web vitals for that page?
- what about Route Enhancers, how will we work with that?
- what should be configurable?
- Analytical output
  - is it useful to get the top 10 and flop 10 Pages of a Site?
  - is it useful to have a historical chart of some sort?
  - is it useful to have a top 10 and flop 10 List of Plugins/Content Elements?

## What I want to do 🗓️

- make it compatible with TYPO3 9 and 10
- make it compatible with php 7.2? 7.3? 7.4!
- save the requests of elder data in aggregate form (to allow large websites to use it)
- add a Dashboard Component
- release into the TER
- [auto release int the TER](https://gist.github.com/einpraegsam/cefeb79a6904e113d208363a4d8aa418)
